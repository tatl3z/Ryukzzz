# [4.3.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.3.1)

- Fix type definition for arrayMerge options.  [#239](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/239)

# [4.3.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.3.0)

- Avoid thrown errors if the target doesn't have `propertyIsEnumerable`.  [#252](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/252)

# [4.2.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.2)

- `isMergeableObject` is now only called if there are two values that could be merged.  [a34dd4d2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/commit/a34dd4d25bf5e250653540a2022bc832c7b00a19)

# [4.2.1](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.1)

- Fix: falsey values can now be merged.  [#170](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/issues/170)

# [4.2.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.2.0)

- Properties are now only overwritten if they exist on the target object and are enumerable.  [#164](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/164)

Technically this could probably be a patch release since "which properties get overwritten" wasn't documented and accidentally overwriting a built-in function or some function up the property chain would almost certainly be undesirable, but it feels like a gray area, so here we are with a feature version bump.

# [4.1.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.1.2)

- Rolled back #167 since `Object.assign` breaks ES5 support.  [55067352](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/commit/55067352a92c65a6c44a5165f3387720aae1e192)

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

- The `main` entry point in `package.json` is now a CommonJS module instead of a UMD module [#155](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/155)

# [3.3.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v3.3.0)

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

- breaking: the array merge algorithm has changed from a complicated thing to `target.concat(source).map(element => cloneUnlessOtherwiseSpecified(element, optionsArgument))`
- breaking: The `clone` option now defaults to `true`
- feature: `merge.all` now accepts an array of any size, even 0 or 1 elements

See [pull request 77](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/pull/77).

# [1.5.2](https://github.com/TehShrike/deepmerge/releases/tag/v1.5.2)
